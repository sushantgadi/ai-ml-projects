Projects during my journey of learning AI/ML

## Projects

### Applied Statistics

#### This project uses Plotting distribution, Visualization and Hypothesis Testing to validate statistical evidence and leverage information to make effective decisions

* Part 1 - Answering Industry Problems through Statistical inferences
* Part 2 - Analyze past tournament information to make informative investment decisions. 
* Part 3 - Analyzing the status of various startups that participated in the Startup Battlefield which is the worldâ€™s pre-eminent startup competition.``

### Supervised Learning

#### This project uses the most popular classification techniques to predict the outcomes after an extensive EDA and work missing values, and imbalance in data. This project has two parts. 

* Part 1 - Predicting the condition of the patient depending on the received test results on biomechanics features of the patients according to their current conditions. 
* Part 2 - Build an AIML model to perform focused marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert using the historical database.

### Ensemble Techniques
#### The project was accomplished by deploying a GUI powered by supervised learning and ensemble modelling techniques to build and train a prediction model for a telecom company. This will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability to churn. This will enable the company to understand and pinpoints the patterns of customer churn and increase the focus on customer retention strategies.

### Unsupervised Learning
#### Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification.
